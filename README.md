## Getting Started

<u>**Installing Forge:**</u>

1. Run normal Minecraft 1.8.9 and once it reaches the title screen wait about 5 seconds and close it.
2. Install Minecraft **1.8.9** forge from the [forge website](http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html)
    - Once you click on the installer you'd like to download, a window will pop up. **Do not click on anything in the middle of your screen**; instead, click on the `skip ad` button towards the top right
3. Open the installer, select install client, and click install
4. When forge is installed, open the Minecraft launcher, go under the `installations tab`, click `new installation`, select the version release `1.8.9-forge1.8.9-11.15.1.xxxx`.
5. Run this new installation that you just created. Once it reaches the title screen, wait about 5 seconds and close it.

<u>**Installing the AutoBonk mod:**</u>

1. Download the latest mod [release](https://github.com/nobaboy/AutoBonk/releases). If it says `this file may harm your computer`, click `allow anyways` as all java files will be flagged by Chrome.
2. Add the AutoBonk mod:
    - If you have java installed, double-click the file, click `install`
    - If not, press the Windows key + R; type `%appdata%`; click on the folder named `.minecraft`; click on the folder named `mods` and drag the mods file in there.
3. Open the Minecraft launcher and run your forge installation you set up earlier.
4. Then, hop onto the Hypixel Network and enjoy bonking everyone that boops you!
